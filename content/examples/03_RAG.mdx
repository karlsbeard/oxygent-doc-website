title: RAG Implementation
description: The following uses character matching for simulation. In production environments, typically retrieve top-K relevant content from knowledge base based on query, and can add multi-path retrieval logic
---

## Overview

This example demonstrates rag implementation in OxyGent.

## Code

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, oxy, OxyRequest

def add_knowledge(oxy_request: OxyRequest):
    def retrieval(query):
        knowledage_dict = {
            "211 delivery": "**JD 211 Delivery Service**: Orders placed before 11:00 AM (or 10:00 AM in some cities) are delivered the same day; orders placed before 11:00 PM are delivered by 3:00 PM the next day. (Note: Timing starts from order submission for in-stock orders, and from payment completion for prepaid orders)",
            "mission": "JD's mission is 'Technology for a Better Life'.",
            "vision": "JD's vision is to become the world's most trusted company.",
            "values": "JD's core values are: Customer First, Innovation, Fighting Spirit, Responsibility, Gratitude, and Integrity.",
        }
        return "\n\n".join([v for k, v in knowledage_dict.items() if k in query])

    oxy_request.arguments["knowledge"] = retrieval(oxy_request.get_query())
    return oxy_request

oxy_space = [
    oxy.HttpLLM(
        name="default_llm",
        api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
        base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
        model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
        llm_params={"temperature": 0.1},
    ),
    oxy.ChatAgent(
        name="QA_agent",
        llm_model="default_llm",
        prompt="You are a helpful assistant! You can refer to the following knowledge to answer questions:\n${knowledge}",   # Placeholder
        func_process_input=add_knowledge,   # Inject knowledge information into prompt
    ),
]

async def main():
    async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
        await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What is JD's 211 delivery service?")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Points

- This example shows how to use OxyGent for rag implementation
- Follow the code comments for detailed explanations
- Make sure to set up your environment variables before running

## Running the Example
