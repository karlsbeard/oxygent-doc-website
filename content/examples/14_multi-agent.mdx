title: Multi-Agent System
description: The following uses character matching for simulation. In production environments, typically retrieve top-K relevant content from knowledge base based on query, and can add multi-path retrieval logic
---

## Overview

This example demonstrates multi-agent system in OxyGent.

## Code

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, oxy
from pydantic import Field

jd_docs_fh = oxy.FunctionHub(name="jd_docs_tools")

@jd_docs_fh.tool(description="A tool that can retrieve JD-related knowledge")
def retrieval(query: str = Field(description="What aspect of knowledge")) -> str:
    """The following uses character matching for simulation. In production environments, typically retrieve top-K relevant content from knowledge base based on query, and can add multi-path retrieval logic"""
    knowledage_dict = {
        "211_delivery": "**JD 211 Delivery Service**: Orders placed before 11:00 AM (or 10:00 AM in some cities) are delivered the same day; orders placed before 11:00 PM are delivered by 3:00 PM the next day. (Note: Timing starts from order submission for in-stock orders, and from payment completion for prepaid orders)",
        "mission": "JD's mission is 'Technology for a Better Life'.",
        "vision": "JD's vision is to become the world's most trusted company.",
        "values": "JD's core values are: Customer First, Innovation, Fighting Spirit, Responsibility, Gratitude, and Integrity.",
    }
    return "\n\n".join([v for k, v in knowledage_dict.items() if k in query])

    ),

async def main():
    async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
        await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now, record to log.txt in local_file folder")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```
