# ParallelAgent

## Definition

Agent that executes tasks in parallel across multiple team members.

## Applicable Scenarios

Suppose you need to use agents to accomplish business needs, and if the capacity of the agent model is small, you can use agent clusters to enhance your thinking skills. OxyGent natively supports the parallel work of agents, which can synthesize the execution results of multiple groups of agents and automatically summarize and reflect. You can arrange agents like a real work organization without worrying about conflicts between agents.

## Configuration Options

### Parameters

| Parameter       | Type / Allowed value | Default | Description                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *None declared* | —                    | —       | `ParallelAgent` adds **no new dataclass fields**; it inherits every parameter from `LocalAgent` (and its bases). |

### Methods

| Method                        | Coroutine (async) | Return Value  | Purpose (concise)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_execute(self, oxy_request)` | Yes               | `OxyResponse` | Distributes the incoming task to all permitted tools **concurrently**, collects their outputs, then uses the agent's LLM to summarise those parallel results into a single response.  |

### Inherited

Please refer to the LocalAgent class for inherited parameters and methods.

## Quick Start

This code demonstrates the design of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for conducting comprehensive feasibility assessments of AI product projects. The system employs `ParallelAgent` to schedule multiple expert teams to work in parallel, achieving a true agentic working model:

- **tech_expert**: Expert in assessing the technical feasibility of AI products
- **business_expert**: Expert in assessing the commercial value of AI products
- **risk_expert**: Expert in AI-project risk assessment
- **legal_expert**: Expert in legal compliance for AI products
